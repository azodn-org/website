Forrest Walker is a retired Navy SEAL, a decorated battlefield leader, and an advanced SEAL program designer. He was among the very first Special Operators to deploy to Afghanistan in direct response to the 9/11 tragedy. His unit was the centerpiece of a task force that was the first SEAL-led unit since the Vietnam conflict to earn the highest unit award, the Presidential Unit Citation. Since retiring from the US Navy, Forrest has augmented his deep experience in leadership roles and program development with graduate business degrees in Global Leadership and Organization Development.
Forrest is the President of Trident Pacific Consulting (TPC). TPC specializes in workforce engagement, leadership effectiveness, work design, and process efficiency. The capacities for growth, product/service diversification, and market effectiveness are all found in capacities already present in most businesses. TPC’s ever-present goal is liberating capacities from within the overlapping and interdependent social networks found in every company.
Forrest is a business consultant and executive coach and lives with his wife and 4 children in Rancho Santa Fe, California.
