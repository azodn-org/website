Digital Transformation Is More Than Digital Transformation featuring Mark LaScola and David Casey

01/24/2023, 12:00 PM – 1:30 PM @ Zoom

Join us for a provocative conversation around what digital transformation is and isn’t. In a world full of corporate buzzwords, digital transformation gets thrown around without considering the full impact across an entire organization. Digital transformation doesn’t exist in a vacuum, it requires more than an online platform, and an organization needs to be part of the journey.

After 33+ years in business and 450+ redesigns, ON THE MARK has more experience creating sustainable change than any other firm.

The Speakers
Mark LaScola, Founder & Managing Partner
Mark founded OTM in 1990 after completing a Bachelor of Arts in Psychology from Fresno State University (1980) and an interdisciplinary Master of Science in Marriage and Family Therapy from San Jose State University (1985) – where his work focused on systems theory and its application to human systems and processes.
Having himself successfully delivered over 450 redesigns and 600 engagements, Mark has also trained and developed roughly 5,000 executives, managers and internal change agents – across a broad and diverse range of industries on 6 continents.
Mark shares his experience and supports the wider industry through regular publication of best practices and is the author of the industry’s most integrated and comprehensive re-design/transformation solution.
David Casey, Corporate and Business Development Director
Dave’s career began in the British Army, where he served for nearly 30 years. The only constant throughout his time in the Military was organizational change. His experience, however, was that change while always planned was managed badly, and rarely achieving the lasting results that were sought. Dave passionately believes in the benefits of collaborative operating model modernisation and organisation design work.
Dave shares OTM’s common values: honesty; integrity and courage, a drive and determination to make change relevant, meaningful, and practical based on real not faux collaboration. He leads on building the OTM business to bring the benefits of collaborative organization design to companies around the globe.
