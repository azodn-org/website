      <description>About AzODN The Arizona Organization Development Network (AzODN) was founded in 1999 by a dedicated group of OD professionals looking to create opportunities to learn, grow, and share together in the Phoenix area. More than 20 years later, we continue to bring these same values to life with quality programming and opportunities to network.
AZODN is a 501(c)6 nonprofit membership organization led by a volunteer Board of Directors.
From those just investigating the world of OD to those that are seasoned professionals, from the valleys to the mountains of Arizona, all are welcome here!</description>
